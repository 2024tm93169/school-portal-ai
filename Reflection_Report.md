# Reflection Report (Manual vs AI-Assisted)

**Scope parity:** Both phases implement identical features. Phase 2 focuses on code quality, security, and UX polish.

**Efficiency:** AI accelerated repetitive coding (e.g., hashing integration, validation boilerplate). Manual Phase 1 was slower but deepened understanding of each flow.

**Quality:** Phase 2 has clearer error handling, safer password storage, and small UX improvements. API surface remained unchanged for fair comparison.

**Learning:** AI suggestions required review and adaptation. This strengthened our grasp of Flask auth, validation, and React UX patterns.

**Limits:** AI occasionally proposed code not aligned to our context (variable names, extra libs). Careful edits & tests were necessary.

**Conclusion:** AI was a productive pair programmer. Manual implementation built core understanding; AI helped refine it.
